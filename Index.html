        <p id="homepara1">
            I am currently a student of Computer Science, majoring in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Data Science (DS).
            Along with my core subjects , I'm exploring Full Stack Web Development and Android App Development
            to build a solid foundation in coding while learning advanced topics like LLM's and Data Structures & Algorithms.
        </p>
        <p id="homepara2">
            Beyond programming, I have also developed a strong interest in Visual Editing and VFX.
            What started as curiosity soon became a creative passion allowing me to combine storytelling and
            visuals into impactful designs. My editing style focuses on clean transitions, cinematic effects,
            and engaging motion to bring every concept to life.
        </p>
        <p id="homepara3">
            You can check out some of my work in the <a href="Projects.html">Projects</a> section.
            If you'd like to collaborate or work with me in the future, feel free to
            <a href="Contact.html">get in touch</a>. I'm always open to creative ideas and challenging projects.
